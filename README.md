## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Everyone in the world wants to use their money better, to better understand how their investments are performing and how their money is being used. There are countless separate sources where people invest or choose to store their money, but that's where this simple finance tracker comes in. It serves as a simple home base for people to track their money across all sources, analyze how it's growing, and receive an overall financial report on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. The tool is simple but powerful because of it's broad scope--it provides a bird's eye view of your personal finances. It also provides the ability to share an individual investment with another individual, which allows you to compare investment strategy with friends and family.

### Design

One page provides login information, while the next page provides information about each amount of money you have invested in different sources, each with an optional button to share with other users. Underneath there is a totals section that provides information about the total amount of money invested, while there is also a shared values section in the lower-right hand side of the second page.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Provides skeleton-like structure of first page, login page. Also provides structure and content for second page with information on investments and hyperlink at the bottom for Github.
- **CSS** - Aesthetic design that can appear on many devices. Most importantly easily visible investment totals and well selected colors for contrast/simple design.
- **React** - Uses React for simple login and routing of shared investment totals between accounts.
- **Service** - Backend service saves login information and shared information, with third-party access for investment information (i.e. stock or coin value).
- **DB/Login** - Secure credentials stored, can't access financial information without credentials.
- **WebSocket** - Broadcasts shared information inputs to other users.
