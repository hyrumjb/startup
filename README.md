### Elevator pitch

Everyone in the world wants to use their money better, to better understand how their investments are performing and how their money is being used. There are countless separate sources where people invest or choose to store their money, but that's where this simple finance tracker comes in. It serves as a simple home base for people to track their money across all sources, analyze how it's growing, and receive an overall financial report on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. The tool is simple but powerful because of it's broad scope--it provides a bird's eye view of your personal finances. It also provides the ability to share an individual investment with another individual, which allows you to compare investment strategy with friends and family.
